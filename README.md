This is a chrome and edge extension, that allows the user to type in a URL of a website chose the days and time so that you can't access the website during that time, and you can't unblock it while the extension is on action.
I've developed this with the purpose of increasing productivity, by taking out things that could distract me during work, like YouTube or Instagram. It's also a way to start taking a little bit more of control over my time.
I haven't published this yet, but i will as soon I'm able to better the design of the extension and make sure everything is working fine.
